# Sattu: The Ancient Superfood Making a Modern Comeback

Long before protein powders and energy bars, Bihar had sattu – the original superfood that's now catching the attention of nutritionists worldwide.

## What is Sattu?

Sattu is flour made from roasted gram (chana). The chickpeas are first roasted, then ground into a fine powder. This simple process creates a versatile ingredient that has been a staple in Bihari households for centuries.

## Nutritional Powerhouse

Here's why health experts are excited about sattu:

### High Protein Content
A 100g serving of sattu contains approximately 20-25g of protein, making it an excellent plant-based protein source.

### Rich in Fiber
The high fiber content aids digestion and promotes gut health.

### Low Glycemic Index
Sattu releases energy slowly, keeping you fuller for longer and maintaining stable blood sugar levels.

### Cooling Properties
In Ayurveda, sattu is considered to have cooling properties, making it ideal for hot summers.

## Traditional Uses

### Sattu Sharbat
The classic summer cooler – sattu mixed with water, lemon, roasted cumin, and black salt. It's like a natural electrolyte drink!

### Sattu Paratha
Parathas stuffed with spiced sattu make for a protein-packed breakfast.

### Litti
The most famous use – sattu mixed with spices becomes the filling for Bihar's iconic Litti.
