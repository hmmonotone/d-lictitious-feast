# d'LITTIcious Grand Opening: A New Chapter Begins

Dear food lovers,

We are absolutely thrilled to announce that d'LITTIcious is now open!

## Our Dream, Realized

What started as a dream to bring authentic Bihari cuisine to the forefront has finally become reality. After months of preparation, recipe testing, and meticulous planning, we're ready to serve you the flavors of Bihar like you've never experienced before.

## What Makes Us Different

### Authenticity First
Every recipe at d'LITTIcious has been sourced from traditional Bihari homes. We've worked with grandmothers, home cooks, and local experts to ensure our food tastes just like it should – authentic, soulful, and comforting.

### Premium Ingredients
We source our sattu from Bihar, our spices from traditional suppliers, and our vegetables from local organic farms. Quality is not negotiable.

### Modern Presentation
While our recipes are traditional, our presentation is contemporary. We believe Bihari cuisine deserves to be showcased with the same elegance as any world cuisine.

## Our Menu Highlights

- **Classic Litti Chokha** - Our signature, prepared over coal fire
- **Bihari Mutton Curry** - Slow-cooked for hours
- **Sattu Paratha** - A protein-packed breakfast favorite
- **Thekua & Makhana Kheer** - For the sweet ending

## Visit Us

We're located in the heart of the city, ready to welcome you with warm hospitality and warmer food.

**Opening Hours:**
- Monday to Sunday: 11 AM - 10 PM
- Weekend Brunch: 9 AM - 12 PM

## Grand Opening Special

## Thank You

To everyone who believed in this dream and supported us – thank you. This is just the beginning.

We can't wait to serve you!

With love and litti,
**The d'LITTIcious Family**
