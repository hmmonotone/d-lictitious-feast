# Traditional Foods of Chhath Puja: A Culinary Journey

Chhath Puja, the ancient Vedic festival dedicated to the Sun God, is incomplete without its traditional foods. These dishes are not mere offerings – they carry deep spiritual significance and centuries of culinary tradition.

## The Significance of Food in Chhath

Unlike other festivals where elaborate feasts are the norm, Chhath emphasizes simplicity and purity. The foods prepared are:
- Made without onion and garlic
- Cooked in brass or earthen vessels
- Prepared with absolute cleanliness
- Offered first to the Sun before consumption

## Traditional Chhath Prasad

### Thekua
The star of Chhath offerings. These sweet, crispy cookies are made from wheat flour, jaggery, and ghee, flavored with fennel seeds. Traditionally shaped using carved wooden molds, each family has their own cherished patterns.

### Kheer/Rice Pudding
Slow-cooked rice in milk, sweetened with jaggery instead of sugar. The use of brass vessels is believed to add medicinal properties.

### Fruits
Fresh seasonal fruits, especially sugarcane, coconut, and bananas, are essential offerings. Each fruit holds symbolic meaning.

## The Cooking Process

What makes Chhath food special is the process:

1. **Purity**: The cook observes strict fasting during preparation
2. **Fuel**: Only mango wood is used for cooking
3. **Vessels**: Traditional brass and earthen pots
4. **Ingredients**: Fresh, pure, and locally sourced

## Why These Specific Foods?

The foods of Chhath are designed to:
- Be easily digestible after fasting
- Provide quick energy
- Have natural preservative properties
- Align with Ayurvedic principles
